## 🔧 Featured Project: AI-Driven Robot Visual Assistant
**[AI-Driven Robot](https://github.com/blondon1/ai-driven-robot)**  
This project is a voice-interactive visual assistant for a robot that combines speech recognition, OpenAI's GPT-4 vision capabilities, and motor control. The robot listens to commands like "What's in front of you?" or "Look for the blue book" and then:

- **Captures an image** using its onboard camera.
- **Analyzes the image** by sending it to the GPT-4 API to determine if the specified object is in view.
- **Acts based on the analysis:**  
  - If the target is found, the robot stops and moves forward.  
  - If not, it rotates incrementally until it locates the target.
- **Provides audible feedback** about what it sees.

The project is organized into modular components written in Python—with options to integrate C++ for performance-critical parts—making it both scalable and maintainable.
